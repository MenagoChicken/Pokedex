# Pokedex

All 150 pokemons on one page with image, stats and description.

The plan is to build a web page that will show all 151 (?) oryginal pokemons in a small cards.
Card will contain:

- image
- name
- number
- type
- (maybe when you click on the card it will rotate and show you more informations - we will see :D)

I would like to also create a live search button for this web page so you can filter pokemons.

API that I will use.

- https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/

What do I need to read about.

- fetch
- how to do live search
- read more about functions and the structure

Tasks:

1. HTML (once I create elements in the HTML I will know how to implemnt them in JS to genarate as many cards as I want)

- create header
  - nice title of the page
  - search button
- section
  - each pokemon will be a separate article
  - card will be contain
    - img
    - number
    - name
    - type
  - back side will have some sort of description
- footer with infromation

2. CSS

- I will think about this later - time to go to sleep tomorrow London and on Satuday 10km run :)
